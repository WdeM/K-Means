# K-Means
Trying to implement K-Means clustering from scratch using one dimensional data.

### Currently implemented steps:

* Plot data in a one dimentional plane P randomly
* Assign starting positions in P for x amount of cluster centroids randomly
Loop.
* Go through every datapoint and find the nearest cluster centroid for that datapoint
* Calculate the mean from previously grouped datapoints and use this mean as a new centroid position for each cluster
Until centroid positions stop changing.

### Missing steps:
* Derive the best amount of K - clusters for the current distribution of data in P
